# Instrument_Tuner

Achieving precise tuning in musical instruments is crucial for producing harmonious
sounds, whether on stage or in practice. This project addresses the challenges musicians
encounter in tuning their instruments accurately.

Instrumental tuning significantly impacts music quality, convenience for musicians,
adaptability across instruments, technological advancements, and music education. It
aids novices in developing a musical ear and enhances musical experiences for professionals
and enthusiasts alike.

The project aims to develop a tuner for string instruments like ukulele and guitar,
empowering musicians to tune their instruments while allowing customization of tuning
parameters effortlessly. Through a review of existing tuners, we identify areas for im-
provement and innovative features. We then explore signal processing techniques and
select appropriate algorithms to achieve our goal efficiently.
